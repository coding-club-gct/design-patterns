This project, called "DesignPattern," is a software application that aims to showcase and implement various design patterns in a practical way. Its main purpose is to serve as a learning resource for developers who want to understand and apply design patterns in their own projects.

## Introduction

Design patterns are recurring solutions to common problems in software design. They help in creating maintainable, scalable, and flexible software. "DesignPatternWizard" exists to provide a hands-on approach to understanding and implementing these patterns. The project uses JavaScript and is designed for developers and software engineering students.

## Design Patterns

In "DesignPattern," we've implemented various design patterns to demonstrate their use and benefits:

### Strategy Pattern
The Strategy Pattern allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. It helps in selecting the appropriate algorithm at runtime.

### Observer Pattern
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

### Decorator Pattern
The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

### Factory Method Pattern
The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but it allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### Abstract Factory Pattern
The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### Singleton Pattern
The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

### Command Pattern
The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing you to parameterize clients with queues, requests, and operations.

### Adapter Pattern
The Adapter Pattern allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.

### Facade Pattern
The Facade Pattern provides a simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making it easier to use.

### Proxy Pattern
The Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

### Bridge Pattern
The Bridge Pattern separates an objectâ€™s abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

### Structural Patterns
The project also incorporates other structural design patterns such as Composite, Decorator, and Bridge.

### Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral design patterns like Template Method, Iterator, State, and Null Object are also demonstrated in the project.
